Welcome to HackMate - Find teammates for hackathons!

Why?
Hackathons are an invaluable opportunity for upcoming developers and engineers to gain experience, but finding teammates can prove to be a challenge. 
Thereâ€™s so much to think about when selecting team members: similar time zones, compatible tech stacks, similar interests, just to name a few. So, our goal is to make the process of finding teams easier for people.
